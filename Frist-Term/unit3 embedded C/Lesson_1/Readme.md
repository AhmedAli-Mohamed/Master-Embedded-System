### Redefinition of primitive data types

```c

#ifndef TYPES
#define TYPES

typedef signed char         sint8;
typedef unsigned char       uint8;
typedef signed short        sint16;
typedef unsigned short      uint16;
typedef signed long         sint32;
typedef unsigned long       uint32;
typedef signed long long    sint64;
typedef unsigned long long  uint64;
typedef float              float32;
typedef double             float64;

#endif
